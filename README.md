# ConsoleApp7

Essentially, this suite of programs converts images to text, which is made to resemble the original image. 
There are three targets in this project; one running in the terminal of macOS, the others are applications with user interfaces for macOS, as well as for iOS.
(Though the iOS target does not strictly adhere to apples design guidelines, and is not particulary stable)
